<H1>Using Git and Branches</H1>

I came up with these steps to avoid some confusion. This should allow you to leave your laptop on your development branch at all times and use the web site for merging your changes into development.<p>
  <H2>Install GitHub Desktop</H2><p>
https://desktop.github.com/<p>
  <H1>Clone the source code</H2><p>
Log on to http://GitHub.com<p>
Got to RobotCode2019v2<p>
Make sure your Branch is “development”<p>
Click “Clone or Download”<p>
Click “Open in Desktop”<p>
Click “Yes” when asked to launch Git Desktop<p>
Select the location where you want to make the copy<p>
  <H2>Create your Branch</H2><p>
Click “Current Branch” change to “development”<p>
Click “New Branch”<p>
Put in name for new branch <your name>-dev<p>
You can now make changes in Visual Studio Code<p>
  <H2>Committing Your Changes</H2><p>
When you have changes you want to save you do a commit<p>
In Git Dekstop <p>
Enter a summary in the box of the Lower Left Corner<p>
Enter a description of what you changed<p>
Click “Commit to <your name>-dev”<p>
In the pane to the right will be a button to push origin to server<p>
  <H2>Testing Changes on another laptop</H2><p>
If you go to another laptop you can check out our branch.<p>
Merging Changes with another Branch<p>
Goto to Git Hub<p>
